`Aldo` is a super fast micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs for Node.js 8+.

At its core, `Aldo` is a dispatcher that invokes a series of callbacks to handle the incoming HTTP request. Thatâ€™s it.

```js
const { Application } = require('aldo')

const app = new Application()

// add a request handler
app.use(({ res }) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
  res.end('Hello world!')
})

// create a HTTP server to serve the application
app.listen(process.env.PORT)
```

## Handlers (aka middlewares)
Unlike the other web frameworks, `Aldo` uses handlers that take only **one** argument the [context](#context), which is a literal object holding everything you need to handle the incoming HTTP request.

```ts
// Handler function signature
declare type Handler = (ctx: Context) => any;
```

When the current handler has finished its job, the [context](#context) object is passed automatically to the next handler, and so on, till the last one.
To break that chain, just return `false` or `Promise<false>`.

### `.use(...fns)`

```js
// to add a handler directly in the stack
app.use(handler)

// to compose multiple handlers into a single handler
app.use(fn1, fn2, ...)
```

You may be wondering, where is the `next` argument ?
`Aldo` doesn't provide it, only the [context](#context) is given.
The `next` function is invoked internally after the current handler has finished.

```js
// the `next` function is called immediately after a sync handler
app.use(({ req: { url, method } }) => {
  console.log(`incoming request: ${method} ${url}`)
})

// the `next` function is awaiting async functions
app.use(async (ctx) => {
  await fetch('some data from the DB')
})

// the `next` function is also awaiting sync functions returning promises
app.use((ctx) => {
  return fetch('some data from the DB')
})
```

### `.catch(errorHandler)`
You may attach error handlers as many as needed with `.catch(fn)`.

```js
app.catch(handler)
```

When an error is thrown, during the request handling, will be attached to the [context](#context) object and passed to each handler one by one, unless you return a `false` which will stop the error handling sequence.

### `.callback()`
Return a callback function suitable as a listener for the `http.createServer()` method to handle a request.

### `.listen(...args)`
Create and return an HTTP server, passing the given arguments to `Server#listen()`.
These arguments are documented on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/net.html#net_server_listen)

```js
// This method is simply sugar for
http.createServer(app.callback()).listen(3000)
```

## Context
The context object is not a proxy to the request and response properties, it's a simple plain object with only 2 mandatory properties: `req`, `res`, which are the `IncomingMessage` and the `ServerResponse` HTTP native objects.

The error handlers receive the same object, but with an additonal `error` property.

```ts
declare type Literal = { [x: string]: any; };

declare interface Context extends Literal {
  req: IncomingMessage;
  res: ServerResponse;
  error?: any;
}
```

### `.set(key, value)`
To extend the request context, and add shared properties, like a DB connection, or a global logger, you may use `.set()`

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test')

app.set('db', mongoose)
```

### `.bind(key, fn)`
To set a per request private properties, you may use `.bind()`. This method takes a field name, and a function to be used as a `lazy` getter of the field value.

```js
app.bind('session', () => new Session(options))
```

This method is very useful, since it allows you to lazily (only when needed) attach a per request property into the context without adding a dedicated handler.

### `.has(key)`
You may use it to check the existence of a certain field

### `.get(key)`
You may use it to get a previously defined field value.
